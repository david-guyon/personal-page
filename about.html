  <h2>About David Guyon</h2>
  <div id="baby"></div>
  <p>My name is David Guyon, I am 22 years old and I’m still student. After I obtained my University’s degree in Electronic and Computer Science in Angers, I went for 9 months in Scotland to continue my studies. I did a Bachelor of Engineering in Computing at Edinburgh Napier University. I obtained my Bachelor's degree and now I do a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the ISTIC laboratory in Rennes (France). <br><br>
  I decided to study IT because I’m passionate by electronic and programming. <br><br>
  By <b>electronic</b>, I mean Arduino cards, the Raspberry Pi with its Gertboard I/O extension and also electronics in general, either analog and/or digital. According to my motivation, I’ll post tutorials about electronics on my blog and videos of electronic experiments on my YouTube channel. <br><br>
  By <b>computing</b>, I aim the programming of ATMega microcontrollers therefore programming in C/C++. Creating applications for OS (Windows and Linux) is also part of my hobby as well as the creation of Android application in Java. I also do Web development (HTML5, PHP, CSS3, JavaScript) and for nearly two years, we (a friend and I) are building a website to present my compositions. <br><br>
  <b>Compositions ?</b> Let me explain. I’m guitarist since a decade now. I am also, in my spare time, pianist and drummer. To be honest, I like to practice any type of instrument, but what I like most is the guitar and singing. That’s why for about 6 years I compose my personal songs. I do all the instrumental part and the lyrics by myself. I will have the opportunity to present all of this in an article on my blog. To discover my creations, go to my website at <a href="http://songaccoustic.fr" target="_blank">www.songaccoustic.fr</a>. <br><br>
  Beside these technical and musical passions, I’m a lover of nature, ecology and sustainable development. I wouldn’t classify myself as a protector of nature because I do not belong to any association acting for this purpose, but each of my actions are reflected in that way. <br><br>
