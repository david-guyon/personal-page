This one week school had for main topic the energy.
There was many talks about ongoing researches on energy in datacenters, such as server and network energy optimizations but also cooling systems and others.
The full program and the slides of each talk are available on the school webpage.
During the week I gave a 10 min talk to present my thesis subject and listed my contributions.
My slides are just bellow.
