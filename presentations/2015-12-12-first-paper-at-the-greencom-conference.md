I presented my first paper at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) during the GreenCom15 conference.
The paper was about including Cloud user into the saving of energy mechanism. In this system the user has the ability to change how energy efficient her application execution will be.
More specifically, by selecting a "green" execution, the size of the VMs used for the run of the application will be smaller than a normal execution.
By using less resource, it improves the consolidation of the system, thus may increase the number of servers that can be turned off.
The preliminary results show that we can save important amount of energy just by taking into account Cloud users aware how the energy they consume.
