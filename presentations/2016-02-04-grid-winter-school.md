During this winter school of the Grid'5000 community, I presented my current research topic.
It was about how we can imply the user into the saving of energy into Cloud computing systems.
The solution proposed here is to provide to the user a simple way to select how "green" will be the execution of the user application into the Cloud infrastructure.
More specifically, we provide an easy-to-use parameter (a knob) that goes from "energy efficiency" to "performance" and depending on the selection, it changes the size of the VMs (flavors) deployed on the system.
