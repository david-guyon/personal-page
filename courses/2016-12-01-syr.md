I've done the tutorials of the SYR2 course for the [L3 info](https://etudes.univ-rennes1.fr/licenceInformatique/themes/OrganisationEtudes/L3info) Bachelor students in Rennes. The course was about writting C program for the students to get use to pointers, C programming in general and also a section about network sockets. The lectures of this course were given by [Guillaume Pierre](http://www.globule.org/~gpierre/). They had a project to realize which was about creating an audio server that sends to a client an audio file (in small packets). Beside the network part (to use the UDP protocol with their own security layer to imitate the TCP protocol), they implemented audio filters to play with the rendering of the music. 

No course materials available.
